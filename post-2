<h2>Before Botox</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a week prior to your treatment, stop oral intake of Vitamin E, Green Tea, Gingko Biloba, Ginseng, Fish Oils etc. These herbs and medications have a blood-thinning effect, which increase your risk of bruising after the treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certain medications like Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Ibuprofen, Warfarin, Coumadin etc. also have a blood thinning effect. Consult your physician/cardiologist to check if it is safe to get off the medications for 10 days or so. If you need a painkiller, use Paracetamol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be honest and transparent with your doctor about medical history, obstetric history (whether pregnant or nursing), regarding allergies and medication history. Do not schedule any important activities for at least 3 days after the procedure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The results are not instantaneous. You will begin to appreciate results in 7 days, and the peak effect will only be noted after 14 days.</p>

<h2>After Botox</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have had Botox injections done to your upper face (forehead or frown in particular), remain upright for about 4 hours post treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No exercise, running, jogging or sports for 24 hours. You can resume other normal activities immediately after the treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For one hour after the treatment, contract the muscles that were injected by frowning, smiling or raising your eyebrows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not rub the injected areas for a day. No facials, steam or sauna for 3 days. If you see a bruise starting to develop, apply cold compresses for a day. Discuss the use of bruise-fading creams or pills with your dermatologist.</p>
