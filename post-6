<p>No matter what your skin type is, a daily skin care routine can help you maintain overall skin health and improve specific concerns like acne, scarring, and dark spots. A daily skin care routine has four basic steps you can do once in the morning and once before you sleep.</p>

<p><strong>1. Cleansing:&nbsp;</strong>Choose a cleanser that doesn’t leave your skin tight after washing. Clean your face no more than twice a day, or just once, if you have dry skin and don’t wear makeup. Avoid washing for that squeaky-clean feeling because that means your skin’s natural oils are gone.&nbsp;Cleansers known to work well for all skin types include&nbsp;Cetaphil&nbsp;and&nbsp;Banila Clean It Zero Sherbet Cleanser.</p>

<p><strong>2. Serums:</strong>&nbsp;A serum with vitamin C or growth factors or peptides would be better in the morning, under sunscreen. At night, retinol or prescription retinoids work best.&nbsp;Makeup Artist’s Choice has an effective&nbsp;vitamin C and E serum&nbsp;and&nbsp;retinol&nbsp;available.</p>

<p><strong>3. Moisturizer:&nbsp;</strong>Even oily skin needs moisturizer, but use one that is lightweight, gel-based, and non-comedogenic, or doesn’t block your pores, like&nbsp;CeraVe’s facial lotion. Dry skin may benefit from more cream-based moisturizers&nbsp;like&nbsp;MISSHA Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream. Most brands will label their products as gel or cream on their packaging.</p>

<p><strong>4. Sunscreen:</strong>&nbsp;Apply sunscreen with at least 30 SPF 15 minutes before heading outdoors, as it takes a while for sunscreen to activate. Darker skin tones actually need more sun protection because hyperpigmentation is harder to correct. Try&nbsp;EltaMD’s sunscreen, which offers broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection and is recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation.</p>
