<h3>Three Main Steps</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of your skin-care routine as consisting of three main steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Cleansing — Washing your face.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Toning — Balancing the skin.</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Moisturizing</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;<strong>Hydrating and softening the skin.</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p>The goal of any skin-care routine is to tune up your complexion so it’s functioning at its best, and also troubleshoot or target any areas you want to work on. “Beauty routines are an opportunity to notice changes within yourself,” says the San Francisco skin-care specialist Kristina Holey. As your skin needs shifts with age, so will your products. Still, she adds, “it’s not about creating perfection.” &nbsp;&nbsp;Allow these three steps to become your daily ritual that fortifies your skin and grounds your day.</p>

<h3>Give it Time</h3>

<p>The science behind skin-care products has come a long way but there’s still no such thing as an instant fix —&nbsp;<strong>you need time to reap the benefits,</strong>&nbsp;says Dr. Rachel Nazarian, a Manhattan dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group. “Results are only seen through consistent use,” she explains.&nbsp;<strong>Generally, aim to use a product over at least six weeks, once or twice daily, to notice a difference. &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tip: With any skin-care product, apply in order of consistency&nbsp;</strong>— from thinnest to thickest. For example, cleanser, toner (if you use it), serum, and then moisturizer.</p>
